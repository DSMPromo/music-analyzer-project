TICKET-001,Chord Detection Accuracy with Complex Arrangements,Advanced chord detection may struggle with complex arrangements that have multiple overlapping instruments in similar frequency ranges.,Medium,Chord Detection,OPEN,2026-01-23,2026-01-23,,"1. Load a track with dense orchestration
2. Enable Advanced mode
3. Observe detection accuracy",Accurate chord detection,May show incorrect chords or low confidence,,,1,
TICKET-002,Grid Quantization Options,"Add more quantization options for chord grid alignment (1/4, 1/8, 1/16 note resolution).",Low,Grid/Timeline,OPEN,2026-01-23,2026-01-23,,,,,,,1,
TICKET-003,Grid Playhead 2-Bar Delay,Playhead line appears 2 bars late compared to actual audio position.,High,Grid/Timeline,RESOLVED,2026-01-23,2026-01-23,2026-01-23,,,,Chord timestamps used Date.now() (wall clock) but grid used currentTimeMs (playback position). Different time bases caused offset.,Changed processFullMix to accept playbackTimeMs parameter and use it for chord timestamps.,0,INCIDENT-002
TICKET-004,Settings Reset on Re-analyze,"Energy Threshold, Min Hit Interval, and Genre Preset reset to defaults after clicking Re-analyze.",High,Rhythm Detection,RESOLVED,2026-01-23,2026-01-23,2026-01-23,,,,Local state not synced with props after re-render. Used defaultValue instead of controlled value.,"Added useEffect to preserve user values, changed to controlled components, pass settings to callback.",0,INCIDENT-003
TICKET-005,Full Mix Chord Detection Not Working,Nothing detected when using Advanced mode with full mix (no stems).,Critical,Chord Detection,RESOLVED,2026-01-23,2026-01-23,2026-01-23,,,,Sparse band extraction lost frequency resolution. Sample rate mismatch. Band separation too narrow.,Rewrote processFullMix with overlapping frequency bands and proper sample rate sync.,0,INCIDENT-001
