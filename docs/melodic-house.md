# Melodic House Production Guide

Reference guide for melodic house music production and analysis.

## 1. Tempo and Foundation
- **Ideal tempo**: ~123 BPM (relaxed but danceable)
- **Kick**: Punchy but not overpowering, on every beat
- **Key**: Minor keys work well (A minor is common)

## 2. Chord Progressions
- Use longer progressions for emotional depth
- Minor keys with resolution back to root for continuity
- **Chord extensions**: Add 7ths for warmth and complexity
- **Layering**: Distribute chord notes across multiple instruments for frequency clarity

## 3. Fifth Bass Line Technique
- Use root note for foundation + fifth interval above for richness
- Put the 5th up an octave for more breathing space in low frequencies
- **Sound design**: Simple waveform (sine wave) + low-pass filter
- Add filter envelope for "brassy/wah" effect
- Separate sub-bass from mid-bass for cleaner low end

## 4. Percussion Layers
- Start with basic: kick, short clap, hi-hat
- Add subtle 16th-note shuffles and intricate percussion loops
- Use velocity changes and slight panning for nuance
- Layer shakers or "tick" sounds to fill space
- Sidechain compression around kick for smooth, cohesive rhythm

## 5. Reverb and Spatial Effects
- Create depth and warmth on pads and percussion
- **Reverb bed**: Continuous background layer for dreamy, cohesive feel
- Stereo imaging on synth riffs and ambient sounds
- Goal: Immersive, surrounding quality

## 6. Automation and Arrangement
- Gradual volume and filter changes throughout
- Start filtered-down, open up gradually
- Build tension and release at key moments
- Create a journey that guides listeners through the soundscape
